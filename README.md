# Hi there and welcome to my little corner of the internet

My name is Ed and I'm a software engineering student studying at HyperionDev at the moment. I've curated my projects from my course with my personal highlight being an inventory manager for independent bookstores (which you can view here [(https://github.com/EdwardTidy/finalCapstone)]

I'm excited to put the skills I've learnt into real world practice, view my LinkedIn here and get in touch! [(https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-tidy-4665b8253/)]
